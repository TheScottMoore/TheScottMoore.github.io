# Algorithms Enhancement

## Overview
This artifact was originally developed for CS-340: Client/Server Development. 
The application was written in Python and connected to a MongoDB database 
to manage records for trained rescue animals sourced from animal shelters.
The original purpose of this project within CS-340 was to demonstrate the
ability to link the front-end and back-end components into a working web
application. 

## Justification
This full-stack application was a great choice as an artifact to demonstrate
my skill in utilizing advanced sorting algorithms, knowledge of when to use
which algorithm (In this case, Binary Search and Hash Tables) to use to optimize
for query and sort time complexity. The enhancements I applied to the original
application are not so noticeable currently, as the database is relatively small,
but would be much more significant if the application were to scale. Optimizing 
for time complexity will shorten query times and use fewer resources to accomplish
task.
