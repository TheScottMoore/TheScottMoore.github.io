**Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Capstone Portfolio**

## Professional Self-Assessment

###Professional Growth and Technical Development


  Completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science has had an enormous impact on my outlook for my future, as it has not only developed many very specialized skills, but also altered my original outsider view of what the field of computer science looks like. I began the program with minimal formal software development experience and only a hobbyist’s experience in coding at all. I went from that so long ago, struggling to create basic decision trees in Python, to clearly designing out large, full-stack web applications. The artifacts in my ePortfolio represent the most advanced work I have completed to date, but highlight my ability to create a blueprint, individually create the large parts of a software solution, and ultimately integrate them. 
  Outside of my artifacts, my course work taught me foundations in graphic generation, software reverse engineering, and how to work with several programming languages, including Python, Java, Assembly, and C++. As my artifacts hint to, I have a strong focus on developing in C-family languages, which, through my coursework at SNHU, I have decided to favor. 
  One notable accomplishment in a course was the publishing of my final project, a weight tracking app, on Android’s marketplace for CS 360 – Mobile Architect and Programming.
  Throughout my coursework, but particularly in my CS 405 – Secure Coding course, I’ve learned how to create applications that resist even modern cyber-attacks such as SQL Injections and improper input validation. Not only that, but my course work in the IT courses has given me a double-perspective on security from both a development and an implementation angle.
  Directly from my CS 300- Data Structure and Algorithms, I’ve applied algorithmic optimization techniques such as database queries using strategies such as the binary search and hash indexing methods included in my artifact.
  The landscape of computer science changed dramatically while I completed my coursework, and fortunately, courses such as CS 370 - Current/Emerging Trends in CS in which complex concepts such as machine learning and Artificial Intelligence were not only introduced, but I was able to create a variety of AI agents based on complex neural network algorithms.
  Software engineering, being my concentration, has been supported by the vast majority of my coursework throughout my program. From conceptual skills such as Object-Oriented Programming and Agile methodologies, to hard skills such as optimization, software reverse engineering, and testing, my coursework has prepared me for a wide breadth of possible specializations. Although this is true, my skills in backend developing seem to be where I am most comfortable.
**Introduction to Artifacts**
	The enhancements displayed in this portfolio all belong to the same original artifact: My final project for CS 340 – Client-Server Development. I selected this full-stack application because it provided an ideal foundation to highlight my skill in all three categories asked of me: Software Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. I chose this artifact because it was a simple, not very secure, not very optimized application that would work as a skeleton for me to fill out.
	The first enhancement showed off my strength in both Python and C++ languages by converting the original Python script into C++ while maintaining compatibility with both the original dash system and the original MongoDB database. 
	The second enhancement was the most involved enhancement because I not only implemented query and sorting optimizations via binary search and vector hashing algorithms, but I also implemented error handling, input validation, and altered the hard-coded credentials to environment-based authorization. So not only was the application far more efficient in time-complexity but followed secure coding best practices as well.
	Lastly, the third enhancement was by converting the original MongoDB non-schema database into an SQLite database. Although this is only an “enhancement” based on use case, it did make the database more modular, simpler to deploy, and more efficient in both storage and computation. To add onto that enhancement, I introduced indexing to further the boons of the database conversion. The data migration was performed by using a Python script that migrated and sanitized the data, as well as create the database itself all in one execution. 
**Summary and Conclusion**
	I have demonstrated the skills that I aimed to learn from this program, such as the technical skills I’ve already mentioned. Along the way, however, my coursework continuously forced the development of softer skills such as project planning, communication with both technical and non-technical audiences, and systems management. I feel confident that my skill set is exceptionally valuable in today’s computer science industry as it’s changing continues to accelerate with groundbreaking technologies such as large language models, neural networks, machine learning, and quantum computing emerge. This program has reinforced that continuous learning is essential even post-graduation in a field evolving as rapidly as computer science.
